Notes (Grace 11162013) 
A reminder for when we set up a client, we need to create the bowlink root folder and associated folders (libraryFiles, libraryFiles/crosswalks)

(Chad 11/19/13)
When you set up an organization (client) it checks for the org folder inside the main bowlink, if not found it creates it with all needed folders.

(Grace 11/19/13)
I meant the library folders for overall application and not for individual organization. I had errors when adding a
library crosswalk because I didn't have the folders - /bowlink/libraryFiles /bowlink/crosswalks 
However, it doesn't matter as those will be our library and when we go live, all library material will be in be copied over.
You can clear this file when it is all set. I will start using bugHub. Thank you!
