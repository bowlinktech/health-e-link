    - Add Grace SP to check the transactionTranslatedIn field if source config is set to pass through and no value is found in the assigned message table
    - Upgrade the site to protect from CSRF
    - Test a Rhapsody input file with edit in ERG
    - Work on encrypting hidden form fields so they can't be changed with XSS


Grace
    - Work with Wayne on setting up the Family Planning template and configurations
    	- finishing testing applying cw to list
    - Look into sendMail for linux - PostFix is installed and running on server already.
    	Just change host to localhost and port to 25 with no username and pw and it will be good to go. (**Grace 06252014**)
	- Review and add additional user logging where needed
	- Load test Dev/Test with BadBoy software
	- Review Status List - make it more user friendly - waiting for MS feedback on end user codes for transactions (6/17/14)
	- Review Reset process - see why can't SDC be reset
		modify to reset target appropriately (*6.25.2014*)
	- Review permission and restrict r/w/x for general users - tomcat/bowlink/UT
	- figure out why DB crashes when record set ie. audit report wiht 1000+ errors - too many queries and tomcat stop responding, need to consolidate
	- consolidate processing activities outbound and pending queries
	- change manager link to more discreet url - done, all links are {web site url}/mgrApp now
	- modify download.do to allow dl only to users with permission - need to modify and see which other methods uses that.  
		 We need to be able to trace back permission with file name or modify the method to be more specific. Right now it is logged. (Phase II?)
	- index db tables as needed
	- add logging for user in front end view
	
Macros needed
How to handle numbers cw matching better - for example, reg1 sometimes submit with 001, 00004 and it really should read as 1 and 4.  Need to see how to handle isNum in mySQL
 - need strip specific leading / ending character ** DONE (Grace ON 6/10/14) ** 
Macro to apply stripping of characters to each value in list (single field)

Open



Wishlist / down the road -
1.  Be able to delete cws
2.  Need to think about how to modify upload files that doesn't fit the 6 bucket model - Reg1 files starts at F1
3.  While adding data translation if one adds a crosswalk, all existing translation will be lost due to the fact that user didn't save.  Maybe prompt user?
4.  Partial Save when setting up a Message Type? SaveToTableName, SaveToTableCol
6.  a macro that will insert placeholder for value pairs
8.  Ability to create a subset of the standard internal standards per organization. These would show on the top of the page on the message details
9.  Would family planning ever use ERG for data entry or review? If so need ability to modify entry/details form to remove what fields do not apply.
10. Does it make sense to split the admin configuration into two (Referrals & Other), where other wouldnt rely on the 6 buckets for the templates
11. ** DONE (CHAD ON 6/4/14) ** prompt user when the same reportable fields are selected or give user better error message when reportable fields selected for display are the same	
12. ** DONE (CHAD ON 6/4/14) ** Be able to import save to table / columns in the template also.
13. ** DONE (CHAD ON 7/3/2014) ** Be able to delete segments, elements and components when customizing an HL7 configuration
14 a. Update the template insert code to accept R, O or D in the required field. R = Required, O = Optional and D = Default
14 b. Update the code so that if D is set in the required field box it pulls default values (Populate from table) in the set up
14 c. Update all configuration forms that have required as a checkbox to be a drop down R, O and D
15. ** DONE (CHAD ON 7/3/2014) ** Allow a Min Admin account that can only see the processing activity screen
