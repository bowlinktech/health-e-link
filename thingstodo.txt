Chad
    - Add configuration screens to allow the user to select pre and post processing macros
    - Continue working on the Harbor Health templates and CCD parsing script
    - Add Grace SP to check the transactionTranslatedIn field if source config is set to pass through and no value is found in the assigned message table
    - Sit with Mike to review Waynes QA feedback and fix any found issues
    - Work with Mike to figure out the HL7 feedback report structure for Harbor Health to integrate back into NextGen EMR

Grace
    - Work with Wayne on setting up the Family Planning template and configurations
    	- finishing testing applying cw to list
    	- continuing 6.2
    - Look into sendMail for linux 
    	- haven't started 6.2
    - Create the SP to return the transactionIn field - DONE 5.2014
    	 - SP returns configIdOut,configIdIn,fieldNoIn,fieldNoOut,fieldColumn,saveToTableName,saveToTableCol
    	 - sample usage - CALL `universaltranslator`.`getConfigToFromFieldNo`(configIdIn, configIdOut);
    	   if a field has no match, fieldNoIn will be zero, we need to decide on action as output field should always be grabbing value from an input field
    - Continue work with encoding and decoding
    	-- encoding input done
    	-- need to work on output 6.2    		
    - Continue work with moving files from UT folder to our Bowlink folders (Referrals) - Done 5.2014
    - Continue work with moving files from our Bowlink folders to the UT folder (Feedback Reports)
		- not done 6.2
	- Review and add additional user logging where needed
		 - not done 6.2
	- Load test Dev/Test with BadBoy software
	- Wish List - prompt user when the same reportable fields are selected or give user better error message when reportable fields selected for display are the same	

Macros needed
Concat Fields - done
CW for handling list - done, handled with Java Codes instead
How to handle numbers cw matching better - for example, reg1 sometimes submit with 001, 00004 and it really should read as 1 and 4.  Need to see how to handle isNum in mySQL
Handle field pairs - macro is not needed, users can use concat fields to generate field pairs
Outbound Macro - returns continue or not - look in field and delete records matching value for given config
	- will discuss with Chad on Wed 6.4

	

Open



Wishlist / down the road -
1. Be able to delete cws
2. Need to think about how to modify uplaod files that doesn't fit the 6 bucket model - Reg1 files starts at F1
3. While adding data translation if one adds a crosswalk, all existing translation will be lost due to the fact that user didn't save.  Maybe prompt user?
4. Partial Save when setting up a Message Type? SaveToTableName, SaveToTableCol
5. macro to strip leading zeros
6. a macro that will insert placeholder for value pairs
7. one that will handle list of values and apply a cw
8. and one that will tell you to continue or not based on if it finds a value
9. Ability to create a subset of the standard internal standards per organization. These would show on the top of the page on the message details
10.Would family planning ever use ERG for data entry or review? If so need ability to modify entry/details form to remove what fields do not apply.
11. Does it make sense to split the admin configuration into two (Referrals & Other), where other wouldnt rely on the 6 buckets for the templates
