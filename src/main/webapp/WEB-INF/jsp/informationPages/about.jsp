            <h3>Advancing Community Healthcare</h3>
            <p>
                With a foundation in not-for-profit healthcare, BOWLink was established in 2003 to provide a cost-effective solution for exchanging vital healthcare information for community-based organizations 
                that did not have the resources for extensive, custom IT development. 
            </p>
            <p>
                BOWlink understands that the widespread availability of the Internet and the connectivity it provides, across the enterprise or community, continues to spawn new opportunities for sharing 
                information and transforming that information into community-wide knowledge. By providing standards-based templates across the web, BOWLink provides cost-effective solutions for resolving the 
                technical issues involved in healthcare data exchange. For all involved in providing healthcare in your community, accurate data exchange is a critical step in delivering safer, patient-centric 
                healthcare decisions and services.
            </p>
