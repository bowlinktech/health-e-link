                <h3>About the e-Referral Project</h3>
                <p>
                    The e-Referral project development has been funded as part of Massachusetts CMS State Innovation Model Testing Award. The Massachusetts' SIM Testing Award projects are committed to providing 
                    better population health, better experience, and lower healthcare costs throughout the Commonwealth. The e-Referral Project aims to transform the Massachusetts' health care delivery system by 
                    creating bi-directional linkages between federally funded community health centers and community-based resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2013, Massachusetts was awarded the SIM Testing Award. Approximately 3.8 million dollars of the award was to fund the development and implementation of an open-source, bi-directional 
                    electronic referral system to formalize community-clinical linkages (e-Referral project). As part of this project, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health planned to pilot electronic 
                    referrals to four community-based resources: Tobacco Quitline, YMCAs, VNAs, and Councils on Aging/Senior Centers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through a competitive solicitation process, DPH awarded three federally funded community health centers to pilot this project. 
                    These sites include:
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Manet Community Health Center: Manet CHC has partnered with South Shore Elder Services, Inc. to provide two bi-directional referrals - Meals on Wheels and Falls Risk Assessment.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Harbor Health Services, Inc.: Harbor Health Services, Inc. has partnered with both the Multicultural VNA and the YMCA of Cape Cod to provide four bi-directional referrals -
                            Nutrition Counseling, Fitness Counseling, Fitness and Nutrition Counseling combined, and Diabetes Education. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Brockton Neighborhood Health Center: Brockton Neighborhood Health has partnered with the Brockton VNA to provide Diabetes Education.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    An evaluation of these pilot sites as part of this project will focus on utilization of the e-Referral system as well health outcomes and cost-savings. The data from the evaluation will be incorporated into planning for a statewide roll-out of the e-Referral system.
